Bitcoin Quantum Desktop Wallet

This does not store blockchain locally at present, it relies on the existing nodes operating as current, if you are opening ports to run a node version of the current Python BTQ please add a pull request so the app can be updated with these also.

Your wallet file is kept locally on your system - make sure to save your details and the json file etc. There is no way of recovery using this program. The system is innately zero-log for privacy purposes as far as can be extended. 

MAKE SURE TO SAVE YOUR WALLET FILE IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTORY TO THE MAIN PROGRAM FOLLOWING INSTALL, WHEN UNINSTALLING (IF SAVED IN INSTALL DIRECTORY) IT MAY REMOVE THE FILE YOUR WALLET WILL BE GONE UNLESS YOU BACKED UP THE MNEMONIC OR SIMILAR.

You can use it as an offline wallet if you disable internet connections on your pc for some of the features.

When viewing a transaction through your wallet do not click the address as it redirects in current window currently, you will need to close the program and reopen.

ADDITIONAL FEATURES

Installer and uninstaller - Very straightforwards, 
Tools Items - Have some fun..

TODOS

Ledger is currently non-functioning due to some code issues
Sort forwarding when clicking address
Add local blockchain to enable further decentralisation
Add NFT Hosting site - You can register NFTs to the blockchain using this app, you can notarise documents also
Update footer links as required - Note this is currently linking to this github account as the bitcoinq dev account is separate.
Create p2p Exchange within app or just an exchange - Another part of this would be creating wrapped tokens with the BTQ network i.e. BTC etc.
Sort out window open maximise to current display
Wording sizing on tools

Original wallet credit to @TheQRL - Took a lot of of reworks to get this working as currently is.
